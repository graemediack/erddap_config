# ARCHIVED
ERDDAP has moved on and this repository is redundant. See https://github.com/ERDDAP/erddap for the latest and greatest new versions of ERDDAP and how to set one up for yourself!

# ERDDAP
ERDDAP is a data server that gives you a simple, consistent way to download subsets of gridded and tabular scientific datasets in common file formats and make graphs and maps.

# This repository
Simple bash script and supporting files that implement the ERDDAP web application on Ubuntu
This script covers my own needs, implementing ERDDAP on an Ubuntu server in a few minutes, and I have created it mostly as a learning exercise, and only partly as a convenient tool while I experimented with ERDDAP. If you know Docker you'd be better using Axioms ERDDAP but this might let you tinker a little first.

## Instructions
* Clone repo to Ubuntu server: git clone https://github.com/graemediack/erddap_config.git
* Run deploy_erddap.sh as root: sudo ./deploy_erddap.sh
* Follow install, enter details as required.

### Notes:

Some important information if you wish to use it for testing:
* Rolls out the most basic implementation of ERDDAP possible, no SSL, no subscriptions and datasets reduced to example "etopo.*", mostly as per the [ERDDAP Installation Guide](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setup.html).
* Most file edits noted in the [guide](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setup.html) are implemented via copying pre-edited files from the *files* directory. See the *file_list* for the names, locations and ACLS (access control details) of these files. I captured the ACLS during my 'why the f*** is it not working this time?!' phase and have left them in place for potential convenience.
* The file *setup.xml* requires user personalised edits, and so I use a big ugly 'read & sed' section to capture user information. Read the notes in setup.xml as per [ERDDAP guidelines](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setup.html).
* Some deviations from the [guide](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setup.html):
    * Uses default Aptitude package for OpenJDK Version 8 (*openjdk-8-jdk*) including default path (view path with *sudo update-java-alternatives -l*)
    * Installs and configures Tomcat version 8 or 9 as per [Digital Ocean guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-apache-tomcat-8-on-ubuntu-16-04)
        * automatically installs latest release of the version you select, in theory should still work when tomcat goes beyond version 9 but no promises ;)
        * directory /opt/tomcat
        * web management configured
        * tomcat.service file created and enabled for autostart on boot
            * This service file includes options used in *setenv.sh* therefore I don't create the *setenv.sh* file mentioned in the [guide](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setup.html) section 2.
* Tested on Ubuntu 19.10 and 21.04
* Assumes minimum ram of 4GB (java options set to 2GB in *tomcat.service* file
